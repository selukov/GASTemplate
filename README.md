# This is a template for Google Apps Script projects.

## To get started, execute the following commands.

– retrieves the ~/.clasprc.json file with the key.
   ```bash
   npm run glogin
   ```
– creates a project; in the console, select 'form'.

   ```bash
   npm run gcreate
   ```
– automatically pushes local changes in your Google Apps Script project to the Google server while monitoring file changes in real-time.
   ```bash
   npm run gstart
   ```

After executing the gcreate command, you will find files in the 'src' directory. Copy the .clasp.json file to the project's root.
